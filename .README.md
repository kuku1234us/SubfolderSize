This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. To install the project dependencies, run:

```bash
poetry install
```

### Building a Windows Executable

To build a standalone Windows executable, you'll need to have [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/) installed. You can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

Then, run the following command to build the executable:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile subfoldersize.py
```

After the build completes, the executable will be located in the `dist/` directory.
